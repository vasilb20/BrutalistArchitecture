                    <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                    <p>Brutalism started in the late 1950s. It descended from the modernist movements in art and is
                        characterized by minimalist constructions that expose the bare building materials and structural
                        elements with little to none decorative elements. It emerged from reconstruction projects after
                        WWII where countries in the Soviet Bloc began utilitarial, ultra-low-cost hosuing projects. The
                        style was then popularized in the UK, US, and in some places in Asia. Unfortunately, it started
                        to decline in the late 1970s and it has been associated with totalitarianism and urban decay
                        since.</p>

                    <h2>Ideological Reflections</h2>
                    <p>The style and its philosophy has been often associated with a certain socialist utopian idology
                        which was supported by its designers (even those who were not living in the soviet bloc). The
                        style was predominantly used in European communist countries (Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East
                        Germany, USSR, Yugoslavia). It was also liked in those countries because it provided a stark
                        contrast to the "flamboyant" styles of the post-modern west. The idea was to create buildings
                        which embody the pragmatist nature of socialism. The eyes cannot be tempted if there's nothing
                        to temp them. </p>
